# Core-memories

This is my first project, created during university.  
It’s a web page designed to collect users’ playlists and display data using the Spotify APIs.

This project was created without the use of AI because it wasn't a thing back then.

Tools: Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, JOSN, Spotify APIs.
